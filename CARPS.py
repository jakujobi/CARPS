C# Automated Rapid Project Setup (CARPS)

This Python script automates the setup of new C# projects. It generates a text file with 
commands to create a .NET project and solution file, streamlining the project initialization process.

Usage:
Run this script in a Python environment. Follow the prompts to input the name of the new project.
The script will generate a text file with commands to set up the project.

Features:
- Creates a new .NET project and solution file.
- Interactive prompts for project name input.
- Generates a text file with necessary commands for project setup.

Version: 4.0

Note: Ensure Python 3.x and .NET SDK are installed before running this script.
